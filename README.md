  ## Description
  Get ready for a cool project! We're diving into the world of regular expressions (regex) to really understand how they work. If you're a fellow web development student like me, you get that coding is just part of the story. The other piece? Explaining what your code does. That's where this tutorial comes in. Imagine regular expressions like secret codes for text. Sometimes, you want to show how these codes work, right? Well, that's exactly what we're up to. We're crafting a step-by-step guide that breaks down a specific regex pattern and explains it all in simple terms.Think of it like a recipe. Just like a recipe has its ingredients, our regex pattern has components. We're taking each one apart and explaining its role. Don't worry, we're keeping things easy to understand. So, get ready to jump into the world of regex, understand how it all fits together, and become a regex pro.
